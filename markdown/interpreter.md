# Designing an interpreter (and also learning a little rust)
![alt text](../blogs/nano.png)
So this project started out as one of the assignment for my
class, which was to write a simple lexer(i.e is a program that takes in some input code(some string) and breaks it down in
to tokens, let say you have a string "a+b" then the code suppose
to give you "a","+" and "b" as tokens) in the language of your
choosing, and as a person who impulsively likes to impose himself to difficult situation, I chose Rust, A language with which I had very very little(tbh none) prior experience and is notorious for its steep learning curve .
